```{note}
   If you want to learn more about Git and GitHub, you can check out the following tutorials: 
   - [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
   - [Git Branching Guide](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
```

2. **Name your Repository**: Name your repository using the following naming convention: `SEA-ISS-2025-<paper-title>`. For example, if your paper title is "My Awesome Paper", your repository name should be `SEA-ISS-2025-My-Awesome-Paper`.


3. **Activate GitHub Pages**: Once you created your repository, go to the settings of your repository, scroll down to the "Pages" section, and under "Build and deployment" choose Source: "GitHub Actions". This will allow you to view your Jupyter Book online.
This will be automatically triggered when you push your changes to your repository. Once you activate this, you can view your Jupyter Book by clicking on the link provided in the "Pages" section of your repository settings. If you have any issues with this step, please reach out to the [conference organizers](mailto:iss_proceedings@ucar.edu).

4. **Environment Setup**: Update the `environment.yml` file and add any additional packages you may require. 

5. **Paper Information**: Fill in the details of your paper in this `README.md`, including the title, authors, abstract, and other relevant acknowledgements. At this step, don't worry about the DOI badge, you will update this later.

6. **Add your Paper**: Add your paper as Jupyter Notebooks or markdown files under the `notebooks` folder. You can use one notebook or multiple notebooks if you wish. You can also use markdown files if you prefer.

    ```
    notebooks/
    |‚îÄ‚îÄ introduction.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebook1.ipynb
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notebook2.ipynb
    ```

    This framework supports [the MyST Markdown language](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/glossary.html#term-MyST) in Markdown and notebook documents. This allows users to write rich, publication-quality markup in their documents.

    [Example paper 1](notebooks/notebook-template) and [Example paper 2](notebooks/example_2/notebook-example2_part1) are provided to help you get started.
    You can either organize all your content in 1 notebook (or markdown file) similar to [this example](notebooks/notebook-template.ipynb) or split it up into multiple notebooks (or markdown files) similar to the [example 2](notebooks/example_2/notebook-example2_part1.md).


7. **Update the Table of Contents**: Update the `_toc.yml` file to include the notebooks you've added. Remove the extra examples from the `_toc.yml` file.

8. **Commit your changes**: Commit and push your changes to your repository.

9.  **Check your Jupyter Book**: Once you've pushed your changes, check that your Jupyter Book is building correctly. You can check the status of your Jupyter Book by clicking on the "Actions" tab of your repository.


```{tip}
**Citations and Bibliography**: For adding citations to your paper and referencing others, please see our detailed guidelines [here](notebooks/example_2/notebook-example2_references.md). In short, after adding your references to your `references.bib` file, you can add the citation to your paper using the `{cite}[authoryearkey]` syntax.
```

``` {hint}
If you are more comfortable using word or latex, you can convert your document to markdown using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). To learn more about how to convert your word document to markdown, you can check out [this tutorial](https://bcrf.biochem.wisc.edu/2022/12/30/learn-markdown-episode-6-convert-word-to-markdown-with-pandoc/).
