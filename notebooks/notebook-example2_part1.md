# Introduction

[Add a brief introduction to your notebook here. This section should include a brief description of the problem you are trying to solve, the data you are using, and the methods you are using to solve the problem.]

You can use LaTeX syntax for equations. For example, the quadratic formula is shown below:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

You can also embed images in your notebook. 
For example, the image below shows the [NCAR logo](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/NCAR_logo_2017_0.png).
